### What is postmortem
In simpler terms, postmortem like a team meeting after finishing a school project or a group activity. Everyone comes together to talk about what worked smoothly, what challenges they faced, and how they can do things better next time.

#### Here are the key steps involved in a postmortem:

- Reflection on Successes: Discuss the positive aspects and achievements of the project. What went right? It's important to recognize and celebrate successes.

- Identification of Challenges: Talk about any difficulties or problems that arose during the project. This could include unexpected obstacles, delays, or communication issues.

- Analysis of Causes: Try to understand why certain things went well and why others didn't. Was it a lack of resources, miscommunication, or something else?

- Lessons Learned: Share insights gained from the experience. What can be done differently in the future to avoid similar challenges or enhance successes?

- Action Items: Create a list of specific actions or changes to implement based on the lessons learned. This could include improvements in communication, planning, or resource management.

In summary, a postmortem is like a friendly discussion aimed at learning from experiences, whether positive or negative, with the goal of making future projects even better. It's about continuous improvement and working together to achieve success.
